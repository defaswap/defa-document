# DeFa Intro

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Trade

{% hint style="info" %}
Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.
{% endhint %}

### Low fees

Why pay more? DeFa runs on BNB Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, DeFa doesn‚Äôt hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## üí∏ Earn

{% hint style="info" %}
Earn CAKE and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.
{% endhint %}

### Earn CAKE with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn DeFa. You can earn high APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn‚Äôt supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).
