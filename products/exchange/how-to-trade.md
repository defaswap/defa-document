# How to Trade

Trading on Defa platform is very easy compared to most exchanges. You aren't going to be overwhelmed by charts or jargon, and calculations are all handled for you.

### **Getting set up to trade**

Before you can trade, you will need a Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet. You can learn how to get one [here](../../get-started/create-a-wallet.md). You will also need to have some BEP20 tokens to trade with. You can learn how to get some [here](../../get-started/get-bep20-tokens.md).

### **Trading on the Defa platform exchange**

1\. Go to the exchange page [here](https://defa.finance/swap).

2\. Unlock your Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking **Unlock Wallet** (you can also **Connect** in the top right-hand corner). If you haven't yet connected your wallet to Defa platform, you can view the guide to here.
